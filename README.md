Introduction:Image classification using machine learning is a process of categorizing images into predefined classes or categories based on their visual content. It involves training a machine learning model to recognize patterns and features in images and assign them to appropriate classes.

The process typically involves the following steps:

Data Collection: Gathered a dataset of labeled images, where each image is associated with a specific class or category.

Preprocessing: Prepared the images for analysis by standardizing their size, format, and color values. 

Feature Extraction: Extracted relevant features from the images, which can be done using techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or other feature extraction methods.

Model Training: Training a machine learning model, often a CNN, using the labeled dataset to learn the relationships between the input images and their corresponding classes.

Model Evaluation: Evaluating the trained model's performance using a separate validation dataset to assess its accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics.

Model Deployment: Deploying the trained model to classify new, unseen images into their respective categories.
